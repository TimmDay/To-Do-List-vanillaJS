You can see the working app [here](https://todo-vanilla-js.herokuapp.com/).

This was built in pure, *vanilla* javascript. No frameworks. Using Model View Controller (MVC) methodology.
My goal was to increase my deeper understanding of the javascript language, so that I will be a more effective debugger across various js frameworks such as React.

It is derived from a [course](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) by Gordon Zhu. I first did it when I was a beginner, and highly recommend it.
I have found having a good theoretical understanding of javascript to be extremely valuable in picking up and debugging new frameworks like React/Redux.
Plus, javascript is eternal (unlike the most popular library when I began learning - jquery) so time invested is time well spent!
